## History

Pixel Beach was originally written in 48 hours for Node Knockout 2017 by Nathan Hoad, Lilly Piri, Ben Hoad, and Jaap van Hardeveld.

A few weeks after the competition, I decided to see how hard it would be to flesh out the gameplay a bit more and turn it into a standalone Electron app.

## Development

To start:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

To build

```bash
npm run dist -- -m # build for macOS
npm run dist -- -w # build for Windows
npm run dist -- -l # build for Linux
```
